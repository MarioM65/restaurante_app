## ⚡ Quick Start

Get the Restaurante App up and running on your local machine in just a few simple steps!

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE>
cd restaurante_app

# 2. Install all necessary project dependencies
flutter pub get

# 3. Configure your environment variables
# Create a '.env' file in the project root directory.
# Add your backend API URL to this file:
echo "API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api" > .env # IMPORTANT: Replace with your actual backend API URL!

# 4. Launch the application on your preferred device or emulator
flutter run
```

## 🛠️ Detailed Setup and Installation

For a more comprehensive guide, please follow these detailed instructions:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin your development journey, ensure you have the following essential tools installed:

*   [**Flutter SDK**](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install): The official software development kit for building Flutter applications.
*   A powerful code editor: We highly recommend [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the official Flutter extension, or Android Studio for a full-fledged IDE experience.

### Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command to clone the project:

```bash
git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE> # Remember to replace this placeholder with your actual repository URL!
cd restaurante_app
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate into the newly cloned project directory and fetch all required Dart and Flutter packages:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Environment Variables

To establish a connection between the app and your backend services, you must configure environment variables. Create a file named `.env` in the **root directory** of your project. Inside this file, add the following line, making sure to replace the placeholder with the actual endpoint of your backend API:

```
API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

**Security Note:** The `.env` file is automatically excluded from version control by `.gitignore` to protect your sensitive configuration details.

### Run the Application

Once all dependencies are successfully installed and your environment variables are correctly configured, you are ready to launch the application:

```bash
flutter run
```

This command will build the application and deploy it to your currently connected device or active emulator.

## 📂 Project Structure

Our project adheres to a well-defined and logical structure, promoting clarity, maintainability, and scalability in Flutter development:

```
lib/
├── home_page.dart          # The central hub of the application, serving as the primary navigation and display screen.
├── main.dart               # The core entry point of the Flutter application, responsible for initial setup and widget tree.
├── models/                 # Contains all data models and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for entities like User, Product, Order, Category, Reservation, and Payment.
├── screens/                # Houses individual UI screens and pages of the application (e.g., LoginPage, MenuPage, OrdersPage, ReservationsPage, PaymentsPage).
├── services/               # Dedicated to handling API integration (ApiService) and core authentication logic (AuthService), abstracting network calls. 
├── theme/                  # Defines the application's visual theme, including color palettes, typography, and overall styling (AppTheme).
└── widgets/                # A collection of reusable UI components and custom widgets, promoting modularity and consistency (e.g., MenuItem, OrderCard).
```
